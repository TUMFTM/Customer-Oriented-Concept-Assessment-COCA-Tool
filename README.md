# COCA Tool - Customer-Oriented Concept Assessment Tool

The COCA tool enables an automated linking between the customer value and the corresponding measurement value of the customer-relevant properties in the vehicle concept. Since a comparison with competitors is always necessary to evaluate the customer value of a generated vehicle concept, COCA contains a database that allows a comparison with different vehicle concepts.
